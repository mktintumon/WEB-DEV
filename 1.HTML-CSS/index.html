    <p>
        Data science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths for skilled
        professionals. Today, successful data professionals understand that they must advance past the traditional
        skills of analyzing large amounts of data, data mining, and programming skills. In order to uncover useful
        intelligence for their organizations, data scientists must master the full spectrum of the data science life
        cycle and possess a level of flexibility and understanding to maximize returns at each phase of the process.

            The term “data scientist” was coined as recently as 2008 when companies realized the need for data
            professionals who are skilled in organizing and analyzing massive amounts of data.1 In a 2009
            McKinsey&Company article, Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist and UC Berkeley professor of information
            sciences, business, and economics, predicted the importance of adapting to technology’s influence and
            reconfiguration of different industries.

            Data scientists need to be curious and result-oriented, with exceptional industry-specific knowledge and
            communication skills that allow them to explain highly technical results to their non-technical
            counterparts. They possess a strong quantitative background in statistics and linear algebra as well as
            programming knowledge with focuses in data warehousing, mining, and modeling to build and analyze
            algorithms.
